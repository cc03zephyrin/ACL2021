Make sure required packages are installed. 
Specify the right path for data. The data path in the code was relative to the original location in my server. 

Names of model:
I used numbers and acronyms for different models.

100/200ï¼š baseline MLP model, 200 is sampling by authors
101: SBBG-VAE
116/216: BBBG-VAE, 216 is sampling by authors
GS: the GS model (see introduction in the paper for the description of this benchmark)
RF: the random forest model
GRU: the Gated Recurrent Units model (similar to LSTM but simpler)
300 BERT+Feedforward
Label spreading: has slow version and faster version, the faster version will eventually by used
Self Training: used RF and XBG both.
